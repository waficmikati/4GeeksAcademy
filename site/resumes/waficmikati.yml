  motto: A nomad with a love for audiovisual interactive experiences
  focus: Web Development & Sound Design
  summary: >
    My passion for web development bloomed from a seed planted by The
    Coding Train. His tutorials for p5js, 

    along with his book "The Nature of Code", inspired me to keep learning and expanding my knowledge of 

    programming. After exploring game engines like Unreal Engine, Godot, and Gamemaker Studio, I realized

    I needed to learn more about programming in general. For that, I ran through Harvard's free CS50 course, 

    which was incredible.


    Eventually I discovered my passion for developing web apps and website for my friends' art as well as

    my own, and have decided to pursue a career in web development. One day, I hope to unite my immense

    experience in as an audio engineer, sound designer and music producer, with my ever-growing knowledge

    of development.

      Studying at Berklee was a surreal experience. Learning from mentors
      who are at the highest levels of their craft, surrounded by some of
      the most talented students I've ever had the honor to meet, was an
      experience that had a deep impact on my career, perspective, and work
      ethic. I cannot express enough gratitude for the lessons learnt in
      such a short time there.

    details: |
      Working with an independent media company like OOBConcept was
      a great teaching experience. I learned to work in a team, make 
      compromises, handle teams with heave stress loads and long work
      hours. It was deep insight into the mechanisms at play in team
      projects, and I worked on honing my skills over the course of my
      independent contract with them.

    details: |
      My artist name is Siku the Nomad, and I have been a nomad both 
      geographically and sonically. I have contributed to many projects
      over the years across many countries and cultures. Some have been
      credited, which you can find on my website, and other uncredited
      due to various reasons. In my life I have learned to work with people
      from all walks of life. I have shed prejudice and envy and focus on
      always growing as a person and reflecting on through the lessons
      taught from all who I encounter.
