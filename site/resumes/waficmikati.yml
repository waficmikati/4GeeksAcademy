    summary: |
      My passion for web development bloomed from a seed planted by The Coding Train. His tutorials for p5js, 
      along with his book "The Nature of Code", inspired me to keep learning and expanding my knowledge of 
      programming. After exploring game engines like Unreal Engine, Godot, and Gamemaker Studio, I realized
      I needed to learn more about programming in general. For that, I ran through Harvard's free CS50 course, 
      which was incredible.

      Eventually I discovered my passion for developing web apps and website for my friends' art as well as
      my own, and have decided to pursue a career in web development. One day, I hope to unite my immense
      experience in as an audio engineer, sound designer and music producer, with my ever-growing knowledge
      of development.

      details: |
        I learned audio engineering with some of the most advanced
        studios at the time, thanks to SAE's amazing studios. I grew
        my passion for art and creation there, and it has been with me ever since.

      time: 2014
      details: |
        Studying at Berklee was a surreal experience. Learning from mentors
        who are at the highest levels of their craft, surrounded by some of
        the most talented students I've ever had the honor to meet, was an
        experience that had a deep impact on my career, perspective, and work
        ethic. I cannot express enough gratitude for the lessons learnt in
        such a short time there.

      details: |
        Working with an independent media company like OOBConcept was
        a great teaching experience. I learned to work in a team, make 
        compromises, handle teams with heave stress loads and long work
        hours. It was deep insight into the mechanisms at play in team
        projects, and I worked on honing my skills over the course of my
        independent contract with them.

      details: |
        My artist name is Siku the Nomad, and I have been a nomad both 
        geographically and sonically. I have contributed to many projects
        over the years across many countries and cultures. Some have been
        credited, which you can find on my website, and other uncredited
        due to various reasons. In my life I have learned to work with people
        from all walks of life. I have shed prejudice and envy and focus on
        always growing as a person and reflecting on through the lessons
        taught from all who I encounter.
